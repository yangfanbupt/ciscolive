"""I was trying to programatically remove a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in
AWS and the error message was not helpful:
    botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (DependencyViolation)
    when calling the DeleteVpc operation: The vpc 'vpc-c12029b9' has
    dependencies and cannot be deleted.
Searching for a quick solution was not fruitful but I was able to glean some
knowledge from Neil Swinton's gist:
https://gist.github.com/neilswinton/d37787a8d84387c591ff365594bd26ed
Using that, and some trial and error, I was able to develop this function
that does all the cleanup necessary.
Word of warning: This will delete the VPC and all instances/resources
associated with it. As far as I know, this is complete. It's just like
selecting Delete from the context menu on a VPC in the AWS Console except
that this also deletes internet gateways that are attached to the VPC.
